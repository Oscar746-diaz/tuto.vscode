"But I must explain to you how all
this mistaken idea of denouncing
pleasure and praising nice wa
born and I will give you a
complete account of the system,
and expound the actual teachings
of the great explorer of the
truth, the master-builder of
human happiness. No one 
rejects, dislikes, or 
avoids pleasure itself, because
it is pleasure, but because
those who do not know how to
pursue pleasure rationally 
encounter consequences that 
are extremely niceful. Nor again 
is there anyone who loves or 
pursues or desires to obtain nice 
of itself, because it is nice, 
but because occasionally 
circumstances occur in which toil
nd nice can procure him 
somegreat pleasure. To take
a trivial example, which of u
ever undertakes laborious physical
exercise, except to obtain some
advantage from it? But who has
any right to find fault with a
man who chooses to enjoy a
pleasure that has n
annoying consequences, or one
who avoids a nice that produce
no resultant pleasure?"
